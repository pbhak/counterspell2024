    This game is about a young man who is trying to reach the afterlife. 
<p>Similar to egyptian mythology, one must fight off demons in order to head into the afterlife. We took this concept as inspiration for our game.</p>
<p>A man wakes up in a dark world, and has no idea where he is, or why he is here, but he persists and traverses forwards.</p>
<p> As he goes on his adventures, he fights off evil versions of himself in a corrupted world.</p>
<p>He has one goal in mind: Reach the Afterlife.</p>
