This game is about a young man who is trying to reach the afterlife. Similar to egyptian mythology, one must fight off demons in order to head into the afterlife. 
We took this concept as inspiration for our game. A man wakes up in a dark world, and has no idea where he is, or why he is here, but he persists and traverses forwards.
As he goes on his adventures, he fights off evil versions of himself in a corrupted world. He has one goal in mind: Reach the Afterlife.
