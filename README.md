# Synopsis

You wake up in a dark room, unaware of your surroundings. The only thing you can see is a torch faintly blazing in the moonlight.
You get closer to the torch, and take it into your hand, gaining vision of the space around you.
As you move the torch, you realize that you're not in a dark room.
You are in a graveyard. One grave, in particular, is cleaner than the others.

After hours of pointless walking on a path, you find an abandoned neighbourhood.
At the end of the neighbourhood stands a figure, with your same size, height, and physical features. 
It attacks you. You run.
As you fight back, you realize that the fighting styles of both you and the enemy are... the same?
You defeat the enemy eventually, and move on.

You go onto the highway, overlooking the city.
As you get closer to the city, you encounter another enemy.
The enemy looks like you again.

As you enter the city, you encounter an enemy.
You feel drawn to a museum in the city, which you enter.

In the museum, you encounter many monsters that you eventually take out with a sword that you pick up
You also remember something crucial that prompts you to return back to the graveyard you started in

On the way back to the graveyard you encounter another large enemy that looks exactly like you, although this enemy is the strongest yet
You defeat the monster and sprint back to graveyard
Once you arrive at the graveyard you look at the grave that you were standing on and realize, that you are dead...
You realize that when you were alive you were a terrible person and each of the beings that you slayed were the bad attributes of you, thats why they fought and looked excatly like you
After you realize this you sit down on your knees, shocked by this new discovery
Suddenly a a door appears out of nowhere with bright light shining out of it
A celestial and divine force draws you to it
And you understand that the door leads to the afterlife where you can rest in peace, knowing that you have slayed your sins and removed the evil within you
You step up to door and accept everything that has happened to you
You take a deep breath and step into the door, into the light.
